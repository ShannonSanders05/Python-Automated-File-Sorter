## Project Title: Python-Automated-File-Sorter

**Description**:

In this Python project, I developed an automated file sorter to streamline the organization of files within a directory. The key features of this project include:

1. **File Recognition**: Implemented a script to automatically identify various file types within a designated folder.
2. **Sorting Algorithm**: Created an efficient sorting algorithm that categorizes files based on their types, such as documents, images, and videos.
